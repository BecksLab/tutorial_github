# Making the most out of GitHub

Although the main draw of GitHub is the version control functionality there are a lot of 'bonus features' that can really help enhance your research workflow.

These include:
-   Workflows (run *small* jobs remotely; NOT an hpc though)
-   Discussion boards
-   Project timelines/goals thing-y
-   Using issues and PR combo to assign and work on tasks
